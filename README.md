## Getting Up and Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 17 or higher
- **Apache Maven**: This project requires Maven for dependency management and building. If Maven is not already installed on your system, please install it first by following the instructions at [Maven Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isacco-B/IncuDO.git
```

```bash
cd IncuDO/app/
```

```bash
mvn clean package
```

```bash
java -jar incudo-app.jar
```

### Important!
- To successfully load the CSV data, ensure the .jar file is located in the same directory as the resources folder containing the required CSV files (utenti.csv, corsi.csv, and prenotazioni.csv). The application will not work if run from a different directory structure.
